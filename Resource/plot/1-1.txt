dia You always get so flustered when it comes to the doctor.
dia But, Amiya, if the worst came to pass... what would you do then?
speLeft Amiya	
dia ...I'm already mentally prepared for that. We would continue to follow the plan.
speRight Medic
dia ...I understand. Anyway, I'll do what you requested.
speLeft Amiya
dia All right... I appreciate it.
dia About the Doctor...
speRight Medic
dia Don't worry, Amiya. All the vital signs are stable now.
dia I'll do one more inspection, just for you.
speLeft Amiya
dia Thank you... Thank you very much!
speRight Medic
